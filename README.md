# 《余光体验》 #
"Sidelong Glance Experience"

一个游戏，规则：
One game, the rule:

只能使用眼角余光观察对象。注视对象便消失。
you can only observe the object with the light from the corner of your eye.

Author notes:

我相信人的眼睛是不会撒谎的，因此我选择这一眼神交互机制。

在sketch运行的过程中，参与者很自然的会把目光放到他们想要看到的地方去，

但是事与愿违，此时参与者失去了观察目标的可能性。

延伸开去，这个作品是一个原型，现实中我们的眼睛也是“选择”地观察这个世界，

我们“被”允许看到什么，我们又主动过滤了什么。

当人自己有看见的欲望去观察而不能得到结果时，

这些本来潜藏在暗处的前提被放到了明处，

这种现实与真相差距的矛盾因此被放大。


I believe that people's eyes will not lie, so I choose this eye-gaze interaction mechanism.

During the process of sketch running, participants naturally look at where they want to see, 

but things go against them. Participants lose the possibility of observing targets.

Extending this, this work is a origin. In reality, our eyes are "selective" to observe the world. 

What we are "allowed" to see and what we actively filter. 

When people themselves have the desire to see and observe but cannot get results, 

these premises that were originally hidden in the dark are put into the bright place, 

so the contradiction between this reality and the truth is amplified.
